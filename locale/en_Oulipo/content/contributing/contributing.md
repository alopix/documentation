Title: How to Add Contributions Date: 2021-04-12 Order: 1

You can add contributions in many ways!

## Ask for Things
Please feel encouraged and welcome to point out bugs, suggestions, feature requests, and ideas for how things ought to work using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues).

## Coding contributions
Code contributions are gladly welcomed! If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the ["Good first issue"](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tag. Because BookWyrm is a small project, there isn't a lot of formal structure, but there is a huge capacity for one-on-one support, which can look like asking questions as you go, pair programming, video chats, et cetera, so please feel free to reach out.

If you have thoughts about how this app works or unknowns about contributing, you can join [BookWyrm's matrix chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#bookwyrm:matrix.org).
