There are a few different ways to add books to your BookWyrm instance! When you can't find the book you're looking for, try these options in order -- it's better to import a book than to create one from scratch.

## Loading books from other catalogs

If the book you're looking for isn't available on your instance, there are a few different ways to add it. The best way is to import it from an outside source -- your instance can load books from other BookWyrm instances, as well as [OpenLibrary](http://openlibrary.org/) and [Inventaire](http://inventaire.io/). If there are no search results for your query, these sources will automatically be queried, and will show up with a button to "**Import book**". If there are local search results that aren't what you're looking for, you can click the "**Load results from other catalogues**" link to load more results.


## Adding another edition

Si vous avez trouvé le livre que vous cherchiez mais pas dans la bonne édition, vous pouvez ajouter une autre édition à l’œuvre à partir de la liste des éditions. Click the link below the description that tells you how many editions there are (for example, "**4 editions**"). At the bottom of the editions list, there is a button to "**Add another edition**".

## Add a completely new book

Once you've tried searching for your book, importing it from another catalog, and finding other editions of the book, you can add a new book manually. Le lien pour ajouter manuellement un livre se trouve au bas de la page de recherche lorsque les résultats des catalogues externes sont affichés. You can also navigate direclty to `/create-book` on your instance.
