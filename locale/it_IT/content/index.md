BookWyrm is a social network for tracking your reading, talking about books, writing reviews, and discovering what to read next. La Federazione permette agli utenti di BookWyrm di unirsi a piccole comunità di fiducia che possono connettersi tra loro e con altri servizi ActivityPub come Mastodon e Pleroma.

## Funzionalità
Since the project is still in its early stages, the features are growing every day, and there is plenty of room for suggestions and ideas. Open an [issue](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues) to get the conversation going!

    - Compose reviews, with or without ratings, which are aggregated in the book page
